## Project Introduction
This project was created because I was doing a subject in university which was discussing the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) if introduced to the medical field. 
I conducted some research, and while artificial intelligence still needs time before it can be fully implemented into the medical field, it has the potential to be very important in the future.
AI has the potential to revolutionise healthcare by providing tools that can assist in early diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. 

This project serves as a step towards integrating AI into healthcare.
It inspired me to do reserach and see how exactly AI can help, which led me to this project which encompasses AI and data analysis, both a core part of my degree and major.
